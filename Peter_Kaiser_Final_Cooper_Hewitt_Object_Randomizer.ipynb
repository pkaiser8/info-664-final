        "During this course, one of the lessons that inspired me the most was our week exploring the PANDAS dictionary and its use in data analysis and visualization. I was also particularly inspired by [the article](https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/museum-life/designing-for-serendipity-in-the-museum-surprise-encounters-with-objects-and-stories?srsltid=AfmBOoqqoX16ArOT_GsRIH56p799nD84dScbdqHVQvBzU6L6Adwf0Cb0) about researchers examining how to design for serendipity in the Victoria and Albert Museum’s collections and how we can incorporate chance into navigating and exploring massive institutional collections.\n",
        "\n",
        "I wanted to explore a well-known public database of design objects from the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum. The API section of their collection webpage shows a [spinning wheel](https://apidocs.cooperhewitt.org/explore-the-data/) that randomly selects preselected values for generating an API query, which also inspired me. With the help of the PANDAS dictionary, I wanted to replicate this wheel by writing a program allowing a user to select their keys manually, then let random chance choose the values in those keys and produce three random records that shared those values. The program allows the user to run the code for new results repeatedly, and you rarely get the same set of records twice."

        "\n",
        "The first challenge I faced was the various values cataloged in the CSV file I found on Cooper Hewitt’s GitHub. The variability of data entry indicates that many museum staff catalogers enter data using different approaches and standards over the years. I saw many slightly different but similar values within the keys. I could condense four or five similar-sounding values into singular ones by refining these cells. I specifically focused on keys like “date,” “type,” and “medium.” I hoped these refinements to the data would create more opportunities for my program to discover similar values. However, given the size of this dataset, my brief refinements and transformations might have only scratched the surface.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another challenge I faced was how many keys from the DataFrame to factor into the program. First, having the user choose three keys increases the likelihood that fewer records share three values. By choosing just two, there is more chance the program will discover three records to output.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, the number of key options was too vast, so I decided to curate the list of keys I know will yield some of the best results from the data, given that those keys contain values that are often repeated and don't contain too many unique examples."
